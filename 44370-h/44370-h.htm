<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The first part of Captain Hanguillart's
little book "<i>Petit Guide pratique
de Guerre pour ma compagnie</i>"
has been incorporated in the new
manuals of instruction published for
the young recruits of the French army
by the official military publishing
house "Librairie Militaire Berger-Levrault,"
the editors of the "Annuaire
officiel de l'Armée."<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>Its special value comes from the
fact that it was written at the front
and is wholly based on the orders
which Captain Hanguillart drew up
for the instruction of his own company
and tested repeatedly through actual
experience.</p>

<p>Thus its very omissions are significant.</p>

<p>The text as it stands represents
essentials.</p>

<p>Its every paragraph is a unit of tried
advice.</p>

<p><b>It embodies the practical data that
has secured results.</b></p>

<p><b>It sums up the cautions that have
saved lives.</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>In the second part, Captain Hanguillart
has merely reproduced the
French Infantry Combat principles
long published in the official manual
for the instruction of platoon leaders.</p>

<p>In presenting this little work, no
claim is made that it is adequate to
the complete instruction of company
commanders.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>Its obvious supplements are such
works as: Colonel Paul Azan&mdash;<i>The
War of Position</i>.</div>

<div class='blockquot'><i>The Army War College</i>&mdash;Translation
of the French Manual for Commanders
of Infantry Platoons.</div>

<div class='blockquot'>Cole and Schoonmaker&mdash;<i>Military Instructors
Manual</i>.</div>

<div class='blockquot'>Major J. A. Moss&mdash;<i>Manual of Military
Training</i>.</div>

<div class='blockquot'><i>U. S. A. Infantry Drill Regulations.</i></div>

<p>Captain Hanguillart's book should
be carefully compared with these. But
because of its peculiar origin it has
for the officer a value not possessed
by other books on this subject.</p>

<p>It gives what a company commander
<b>actually found essential</b>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it corresponds to the
booklets published in France which are
placed in the hands of every recruit.</p>

<p>Every officer should have full knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of his specialty, but <b>every private</b>
should understand the essential concerns
of his officers so as to appreciate
orders the more readily.</p>

<p>The army of democracy should be
an intelligent thinking army.</p>

<p>Such little books have helped to give
the French poilu his famed self-reliance
and resourcefulness.</p>

<p>It is the hope of the publishers that
this translation may help to do the
same for his American comrades.</p>

<p>The publishers also believe that the
book offers just the information needed
by civilians to follow intelligently reports
of military operations and of
life at the front.</p>

<p>The editor has felt it his duty in rearranging
the loose notes of Captain
Hanguillart to respect scrupulously
the text, though, at times, the best
way to do so was through a free translation.</p>

<p>The paragraphs have been numbered
and questions and diagrams added to
facilitate assimilation.</p>

<h2>TRENCH LIFE AND TRENCH
WARFARE.</h2>

<hr class="chap" />


<h2>TAKING OVER THE TRENCHES.</h2>


<div class='sub'>1.&mdash;Leaving Billets.</div>

<p>The battalions of a Brigade occupying
a given sector of the front are billeted
when out of the trenches, in the
villages closest to their sector. Cf. <a href="#Appendix">appendix</a>.</p>

<p>When their turn comes to relieve the
battalions in the trenches, the officers
in charge should have the following
instructions carried out:</p>


<div class='sub'>2.&mdash;On the day before the relief make
sure:</div>



<div class='hang2'>That the rifles, bayonets, etc., are in
good condition.</div>

<div class='hang2'>That the ammunition and reserve
rations are supplied.</div>

<div class='hang2'>That the equipment of every man is
complete.</div>

<div class='hang2'>That all officers and N.C.O.'s watches
are set to division time.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>


<div class='sub'>3.&mdash;On the day of the relief, one hour
before departure:</div>



<div class='hang2'>Have rifles stacked and equipment
laid out outside the billets.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Make sure that nothing is left behind,
that premises are cleaned, all
rubbish burnt, and latrines filled.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Have rifles loaded and with the safety
lock turned to the safe.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Assign an energetic N. C. O. to act
as file closer of each platoon to
prevent straggling.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Call the roll and have it duly forwarded
to the company commander.</div>


<div class='sub'>4.&mdash;On the way to the trenches:</div>



<div class='hang2'>If under fire, have units march at
proper intervals (Cf. <a href="#par_117">par. 117ff</a>.)</div>

<div class='hang2'>Adopt marching order best suitable
to avoid blocking the road.</div>

<div class='hang2'>At night do not allow smoking.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Exact silence when nearing the
trenches.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Take special precaution at all times
to maintain constant communication
between units, especially at
night and when crossing woods.</div>

<div class='hang2'>If enemy aeroplanes appear, stop
and keep out of sight as much as
possible. (Cf. <a href="#par_120">par. 120</a>.)</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>


<div class='sub'>5.&mdash;On reaching the trenches:</div>



<div class='hang2'>The relief should be completed in
silence&mdash;without hurry.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Carefully ascertain the orders of the
battalion relieved.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Check up and assign to each unit the
supplies taken over.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Requisition at once additional supplies
and ammunition wanted.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Each platoon should be assigned its
special duties, the duty roster
drawn up for all sentry and patrol
duties, details, etc.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Have all the men locate the enemy
trench as they come on duty and
give them the range.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Inspect the dugouts and assign them.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Forbid all digging under the parapet.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Inspect the latrines. Give strict order
that small amount of dirt be
thrown in after use and that lime
be sprinkled in daily.</div>

<div class='hang2'>See that the men are provided with
ammunition.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Communication should be insured
between the various units to the
right and left and with the rear.</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>




<h2>CARE AND IMPROVEMENT OF
THE TRENCHES.</h2>


<div class='sub'>6.&mdash;Improvements:</div>



<div class='hang2'>Investigate the work under way for
the improvement of defense and
prepare plans for further work if
necessary.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Obvious improvements are: making
additional communication trenches,
repairing or completing shelters,
listening posts, mining tunnels,
wire entanglements.</div>


<div class='sub'>7.&mdash;Ammunition shelters:</div>



<div class='hang2'>See that there are a sufficient number
of shelters for rifle ammunition,
grenades, rockets and other
supplies.</div>


<div class='sub'>8.&mdash;Loopholes and Parapet:</div>



<div class='hang2'>Ascertain the conditions of all the
loopholes and have them repaired
if need be. (They should cut the
parapet diagonally and be concealed
in every way possible with
vegetation, branches, and the opening
blocked when not in use.)</div>

<div class='hang2'><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></div>



<div class='hang2'>Have all damages to the parapet and
to the ground underneath quickly
attended to.</div>

<div class='hang2'>See that in each section there are
small ladders to permit of easy
access to the top of the parapet.</div>

<div class='hang2'>See that means are provided to fire
above the parapet in case of an
attack.</div>


<div class='sub'>9.&mdash;Drainage:</div>



<div class='hang2'>Attend carefully to the drainage.
Have the trench bottom kept convex
with small gutters on either
side running into pits lined with
gabions. If trench bottom is lined
with board walks, keep it in repair.
Have water pits emptied if
necessary.</div>


<div class='sub'>10.&mdash;Sanitation:</div>



<div class='hang2'>Have latrines kept in perfect sanitary
order.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Have them filled up and others dug
<b>if need be</b>.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Have all rubbish collected and carried
out.</div>


<div class='sub'>11.&mdash;Precautions against capture of
fire-trench.</div>



<div class='hang2'>Prepare for the obstruction of the
communicating trenches in case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the enemy should capture the
fire trench: Have piles of sand
bags above the entrance of each
trench ready to be dumped into it.
Have chevaux de frise lined up on
one parapet of the trench and all
held up in such a way by a single
wire that when the wire is cut
they will fall into the trench.
Mines can also be prepared to blow
up the trench when invaded. The
communicating trench between
the fire trench and the listening
post should be covered with barbed
wire screens or be tunnelled.</div>

<h2>THE WATCH FROM THE
TRENCHES.</h2>


<div class='sub'>12.&mdash;Trench Warfare an outpost duty.</div>

<p>Trench warfare, the inevitable form
of modern warfare, is a continuous series
of outpost duty. Hence it is based
wholly on eternal vigilance. The patrols
correspond to the scouts; the listening
posts to the sentinels; the firing
trench to the outguards; the cover
trench to the supports. The safety of
the sector depends entirely on the vigilance
of the advanced elements and
the rapidity with which supports and
the reserves can be summoned.</p>

<p>Watching is thus the fundamental
duty in trench warfare.</p>

<p>The following points should be kept
in mind:</p>




<h3>AT ALL TIMES</h3>


<div class='sub'>13.&mdash;Number of men in the fire trench.</div>

<p>There must be as many sentinels in
each section as is necessary to cover
completely the sector to be watched, no
more, no less, each sentinel being given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the exact limits (such as tree, copse,
post, etc.) at each end of the line he
should watch.</p>


<div class='sub'>14.&mdash;Fix bayonets.</div>

<p>The men on duty should have bayonets
fixed as, in case of a possible surprise,
they are needed for defense.
Otherwise too, fixing bayonets would
be an indication to the enemy of an impending
raid.</p>




<h3>DURING THE DAY.</h3>


<div class='sub'><a id="par_15"></a>15.&mdash;Observation of open terrain.</div>

<p>When the terrain opposite is open
country, the necessary observation may
be done by the smallest possible number
of men. Fire only, if any of the
enemy are sighted. Then, have two
rounds fired, then three. But keep fire
under strict control. (If enemy continues
to approach. Cf. <a href="#par_52">par. 52</a> ff.)</p>


<div class='sub'>16.&mdash;Observation of covered terrain.</div>

<p>When the terrain is covered (high
brush wood, copses, trees, etc.) a sharpshooter
in each section should fire occasionally
into the trees, etc., which
may be observation or sharpshooters'
posts but this should not be overdone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>




<h3>AT NIGHT.</h3>


<div class='sub'>17.&mdash;Double sentinels.</div>

<p>Post double sentinels in each section,
each man watching in turn, the other
resting but within call.</p>


<div class='sub'>18.&mdash;Silence.</div>

<p>They should refrain from making the
least noise so as to hear and not be
heard.</p>


<div class='sub'>19.&mdash;No firing when fired upon.</div>

<p>There should be no firing when the
enemy fires since when the enemy fires,
he does not advance.</p>


<div class='sub'>20.&mdash;Look and listen.</div>

<p>They should keep a sharp lookout
but listen even more attentively.</p>


<div class='sub'>21.&mdash;In the listening posts.</div>

<p>Sentinels in the listening posts
should listen especially for the noise of
crushed branches, stirring leaves, slight
noise of arms or utensils.</p>

<p>If enemy is detected, these sentinels
should hasten back to fire trench to
give the alarm quietly so that the
enemy may be surprised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>They should fire only if they are
themselves caught unawares.</p>

<p>Listening posts should not be too
numerous, about two per battalion.</p>

<p>If there are no listening posts, patrols
should be sent out to favorable spots
especially at sundown and before sunrise.</p>


<div class='sub'><a id="par_22"></a>22.&mdash;Enemy sighted or heard, fire.</div>

<p>If the night is clear and the terrain
is open, proceed as during the day: If
the enemy is sighted or heard, fire in
short volleys. In case of doubt throw
grenades with the first volley.</p>


<div class='sub'>23.&mdash;Otherwise no firing.</div>

<p>Otherwise, absolute silence should be
observed. No firing whatever.</p>


<div class='sub'>24.&mdash;Unless night is dark.</div>

<p>If the night is dark, to avoid surprise,
keep up firing: One man per section
should fire in turn, from time to
time varying the direction.</p>


<div class='sub'>25.&mdash;Digging by enemy.</div>

<p>If digging by the enemy is reported,
cease firing. Have it located, throw
bombs followed by volleys. Notify
sappers for counter mining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>


<div class='sub'>26.&mdash;Watch for light of enemy's fire.</div>

<p>If enemy fires, note where light appears.</p>


<div class='sub'>27.&mdash;Posting of sharpshooters.</div>

<p>Locate sharpshooters in advantageous
posts behind the trenches (trees,
etc.). Have them fire into the enemy's
listening posts and into the enemy's
trench, especially wherever light appears.
These posts should not be occupied
during the day.</p>


<div class='sub'>28.&mdash;Patrols.</div>

<p>Send out patrols, stationary or mobile.</p>

<h2>PATROLLING.</h2>


<div class='sub'>29.&mdash;Functions of Patrols.</div>

<p>The aim: to supplement the work
of the listening posts and of the sentinels
through more forward observation.
To discover the movements and
the operations of the enemy. To locate
his emplacements.</p>

<p>To keep in close touch with the enemy
so as to take advantage of his possible
weaknesses: lack of watchfulness, of
ammunition, of sufficient troops. To
verify, repair and complete advance defences.
To get the exact range of
enemy's positions. To bring back
prisoners.</p>


<div class='sub'>30.&mdash;Time to patrol.</div>

<p>Patrols should be on duty through
the night but be specially watchful before
sunrise.</p>


<div class='sub'>31.&mdash;Assignment of patrol duty.</div>

<p>N. C. O. and men should be assigned
to patrol duty by roster or as volunteers.
In the former case, if there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
reason to think that a patrol has not
done its best to secure information, the
same men should be sent out again.</p>


<div class='sub'>32.&mdash;Sentinels should know about patrols.</div>

<p>Neighboring companies should be
notified of the departure, route and
probable time of return of patrols. If
several patrols are sent out at the same
time they should know one another's
itinerary.</p>


<div class='sub'>33.&mdash;Dress and equipment of patrols.</div>

<p>The men (3 to 5 commanded by N.
C. O.) should carry no impediments
and their dress should not interfere
with ease of movements: sweaters
should be worn instead of overcoats.
The woolen cap or comforter should be
worn as they cover most of the face.
Slits should be cut for the ears that
hearing be not interfered with. The
helmet should always be worn over
comforter. Also dark gloves to hide
the hands. No equipment save the
rifle, the bayonet fixed or carried in
the hand, (no bayonet scabbard), a
few hand grenades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>


<div class='sub'>34.&mdash;Method of advance.</div>

<p>Patrols should crawl forward or advance
by short dashes, silently, stop
often and for long periods, listen intently.</p>


<div class='sub'>35.&mdash;Under flare light.</div>

<p>If the enemy sends up lighting rockets
(flares) or fires volleys, lie flat on
the ground until he stops.</p>


<div class='sub'>36.&mdash;Against an hostile patrol.</div>

<p>If a small hostile patrol approaches,
do the same, throw a stone or two so
as to turn its attention away and take
advantage of this to surprise it. If men
of enemy's patrol give the alarm, kill
them&mdash;lie flat on ground during enemy's
volleys which will follow. Then
strip bodies of distinctive uniform
badges, and search for papers, etc.
Otherwise bring men back as prisoners.</p>


<div class='sub'>37.&mdash;Need of initiative.</div>

<p>Patrols should exercise initiative,
take advantage of circumstances, in devising
ways of bringing back the greatest
possible amount of useful information.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>




<h2>INTERROGATING PRISONERS.</h2>


<div class='sub'>38.&mdash;Information from prisoners.</div>

<p>One of the chief aims of patrolling
is to bring back prisoners from whom
information may be gathered.</p>


<div class='sub'>39.&mdash;Its use by General Staff.</div>

<p>The General Staff is interested to
know the nationality, the division, the
age, etc. of prisoners captured in a given
sector.</p>


<div class='sub'>40.&mdash;Its use by company commander.</div>

<p>But these are of little value to the
battalion or company commander.
Hence, when possible, they should ask
the prisoners questions more pertinent
to the organization of the enemy sector
opposite:</p>


<div class='sub'>41.&mdash;Questions to ask.</div>

<p>How strongly are your various lines
held?</p>

<p>Where are the C. O. Post and the
officers' dugouts?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>When and by what routes are the
reliefs made, how often and on what
days and at what time. Ask the same
questions for the fatigues.</p>

<p>At what time are rations brought or
served?</p>

<p>What is the actual muster of the
company?</p>

<p>How many regular army officers,
how many reserve officers? What do
the men think of their officers?</p>

<p>How many advanced posts? How
many men in each, by day and by
night? Do they have grenades and
how are they relieved?</p>

<p>How many men are sent out on patrol,
how often, at what time, by what
route coming and going? How are they
dressed and armed? What are their
instructions?</p>

<p>What does the enemy know about
our own patrols?</p>

<p>Are snipers placed in trees during
the day and at night? If so, what trees
are used. What parts of our sectors
can they see?</p>

<p>Are they planning any raids? Do
they anticipate raids by us?</p>

<p>What work are they carrying on during
the day and at night?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Have they any idea of our own activities?</p>

<p>What is the nature and the location
of their accessory defences?</p>

<p>What is the location of their machine
guns, trench mortars?</p>

<p>Have they any asphyxiating gas or
liquid fire apparatus?</p>

<p>Have they abundant supplies of hand
grenades, etc., etc.</p>

<h2>DEVICES TO DRAW THE
ENEMY'S FIRE.</h2>


<div class='sub'>42.&mdash;To make enemy waste ammunition.</div>

<p>Any devices which lead the enemy to
waste ammunition or to expose themselves
is a clear gain.</p>

<p>Many may be readily devised and
officers and men should be encouraged
to do so. The following have often
proved successful:</p>


<div class='sub'>43.&mdash;Pretend abandoning trench.</div>

<p>Remain absolutely quiescent during
several days. This may lead the enemy
to send out patrols or raiding parties
which may be the more surely destroyed.
They should be allowed to approach
to the wire entanglements before
a shot is fired.</p>


<div class='sub'>44.&mdash;Pretend a raid.</div>

<p>On dark nights, have all firing stop.
Throw stones by hand or with slings,
a dozen at a time toward the enemy's
trench. This will lead him to fire repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
volleys and waste ammunition
in his fear of an attack, especially if
the trenches are in wooded terrain and
there are leaves on the ground. Repeat
several times during the night.</p>

<p>Patrols may also tie strings to the
enemy's barb wire. On dark nights
pulling on the string may lead the
enemy to fire.</p>


<div class='sub'>45.&mdash;Use decoys.</div>

<p>Decoys may be arranged in trees or
stuck up momentarily over the parapet.
They will draw the enemy's fire.</p>


<div class='sub'>46.&mdash;Pretend a fire attack.</div>

<p>If the enemy's trenches are near
enough for the sound to carry, whistles
may be blown all along the line before
a volley. They may be blown again
after the command to omit the volley.
The enemy may continue to fire indefinitely.</p>


<div class='sub'>47.&mdash;Watch out for enemy's ruses.</div>

<p>Let the aim of all these devices be
to make the enemy waste ammunition
and to save your own. On the other
hand, the enemy is likely to attempt
like ruses and many others which are
not permissible such as the use of white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
flags or raising hands to indicate pretended
surrender.</p>


<div class='sub'>48.&mdash;His use of blank cartridges.</div>

<p>A legitimate ruse, of which the enemy
is fond and which should be guarded
against, consists in their firing blank
cartridges to mask an advance of their
men. It is clear that men do not advance
while bullets are fired from
their own trenches. Nor does one fire
in retaliation until the enemy's fire
ceases. A little attention will be sufficient
to spoil this plan as, when only
blank cartridges are fired, no bullets
will whiz by. As long as the enemy
fires blank cartridges, withhold your
own fire, be on guard against the appearance
of patrols and be ready to
receive them when they draw near.</p>


<div class='sub'>49.&mdash;His use of flares.</div>

<p>In case the enemy sends up flares,
patrols should lie flat and motionless
till after the volley which often follows.
The sentinels in the fire trench should
note spot where flare was sent up and
abstain from firing unless enemy is
sighted out of his trenches.</p>


<div class='sub'>50.&mdash;His machine guns.</div>

<p>If a machine gun opens fire from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
trench opposite, try to locate it through
the light and sound at night, through
sound and actual sight during the day.</p>

<p>Fire a converging volley of two
rounds in its direction, and repeat, but
not over six rounds if unsuccessful.</p>

<p>At the same time let trench mortars
fire bombs in the same direction.</p>


<div class='sub'>51.&mdash;His field and trench artillery fire.</div>

<p>If enemy's artillery fires upon
trenches (Cf. <a href="#par_69">par. 69</a> ff.)</p>

<h2>AN ATTACK.</h2>


<h2>THE REPULSE.</h2>


<div class='sub'><a id="par_52"></a>52.&mdash;A threatened raid.</div>

<p>As has been stated (<a href="#par_15">par. 15</a> and <a href="#par_22">22</a>)
in case enemy patrols approach, volleys
of two, then of three rounds
should be fired. Keep cool. Do not
fire prematurely.</p>


<div class='sub'>53.&mdash;Fire above parapet.</div>

<p>The firing should be done over the
parapet and not through the loopholes.</p>


<div class='sub'>54.&mdash;When alarm is given.</div>

<p>If the sentinels report that an attack
is developing, every one on duty takes
his post.</p>


<div class='sub'>55.&mdash;Flares.</div>

<p>Flares are sent up from each section.</p>


<div class='sub'>56.&mdash;Trench Mortars.</div>

<p>Trench mortars fire bombs with the
first volley.</p>


<div class='sub'>57.&mdash;How to repulse an attack.</div>

<p>If the attack materializes, repeat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
volleys and trench mortar discharge
and open fire with the machine guns.</p>

<p>(On dark nights, in covered terrain,
the machine guns should be fired with
the first volley.)</p>


<div class='sub'>58.&mdash;Use of hand grenades.</div>

<p>Hand grenades should be thrown as
soon as the enemy is within 30 yards.</p>

<p>The grenadiers of the odd number
squads should aim to throw their grenades
upon the assailants while those
of the even number squads should try
to establish a barrage by throwing behind
the assailants.</p>


<div class='sub'>59.&mdash;Use of trench mortars.</div>

<p>The trench mortars are aimed at the
enemy's trench.</p>


<div class='sub'>60.&mdash;Use of the machine guns.</div>

<p>The machine guns fire directly at
the assailants, with slight differences
in height of aim, (knee high, waist
high, etc.) according to the directions
previously given to each man.</p>


<div class='sub'>61.&mdash;Fire Control.</div>

<p>Carefully keep fire rifle under control
and avoid wasting ammunition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Never fire without aiming. If the
ground ahead is flat, aim waist-high;
if it slopes down, aim close to the soil;
if it slopes up, aim at height of chest.</p>


<div class='sub'>62.&mdash;Repulse with the bayonet.</div>

<p>If some of the enemy reach the
trench, dispose of them with the bayonet.</p>


<div class='sub'>63.&mdash;Save ammunition.</div>

<p>Cease firing and abstain from further
firing as soon as the attack is repulsed.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE COUNTER ATTACK.</h2>


<div class='sub'>64.&mdash;Immediate.</div>

<p>It should follow immediately upon
the successful repulse of the attack.</p>


<div class='sub'>65.&mdash;Counter attack formation.</div>

<p>It should be developed in the following
formation:</p>

<p>1st. Grenadiers armed only with a
bayonet, a bowie knife, a revolver and
a full stock of grenades. With them
a few men with pliers for wire cutting.</p>

<p>2nd. Next a skirmish line of riflemen
with a full supply of ammunition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>3rd. Lastly, a line of men with entrenching
tools.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>


<div class='sub'>66.&mdash;Method of advance.</div>

<p>Proceed by short leaps making use
of available protection and crawl flat
on the ground in approaching the enemy's
trench.</p>


<div class='sub'>67.&mdash;Capture of the enemy's fire trench.</div>

<p>After the defenders in the fire trench
are killed, jump in, throw bombs into
the dugouts, pursue the enemy into the
support and communication trenches.</p>


<div class='sub'>68.&mdash;Organize it against the enemy.</div>

<p>Let then the engineers block up to
the right and left the captured trench
and organize it rapidly against the
enemy, making it face about (through
changing the parados into a parapet).
The enemy is pursued as far as possible
and kept away while fatigue parties
from the rear bring up all necessary
ammunition, sand bags, barbed wire,
etc., carrying back all the captured
enemy material. Other fatigue parties
start at once to connect the former fire
trench with the captured trench by
communication trenches.</p>

<h2>PRECAUTIONS AGAINST ENEMY'S
ARTILLERY.</h2>


<div class='sub'><a id="par_69"></a>69.&mdash;Artillery Bombardment.</div>

<p>Whether preliminary to, in connection
with, or independent of an infantry
attack, the enemy may make use of his
artillery.</p>

<p>This bombardment may be directed
against the fire trench or back of the
fire-trench.</p>


<div class='sub'>70.&mdash;Case I.&mdash;Bombardment of the Fire
Trench.</div>


<div class='sub'>71.&mdash;All in shelter except sentinels.</div>

<p>Leave in the fire trench the necessary
sentinels.</p>

<p>Station all the other men in the shelters
of the support trench, or along the
communication trench, if there are no
shelters, but fully equipped and ready
to jump to their places in the fire trench
as soon as the enemy's artillery fire
will stop or lengthen to allow his infantry
to advance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>


<div class='sub'>72.&mdash;Fire to impede observation.</div>

<p>All through the bombardment, the
sentinels should fire at all objects in
the distance which may be used as observation
posts. The machine guns
should cooperate with a slow sweeping
fire.</p>


<div class='sub'>73.&mdash;Case II.&mdash;Bombardment back of
Fire Trench.</div>


<div class='sub'>74.&mdash;Watch for infantry attack.</div>

<p>All should stand to in the fire trench
watching for a possible infantry attack
and for a possible shortening of the
enemy's bombardment. If it occurs,
proceed as in Case I.</p>


<div class='sub'>75.&mdash;Prevent observation.</div>

<p>Fire against possible observation
posts as in Case I.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>USE OF TRENCH ARTILLERY.</h2>


<div class='sub'>76.&mdash;Use with a purpose.</div>

<p>Whatever trench artillery appliances
are provided, bomb-throwers, trench
mortars, catapults, etc., they should
never be used hap-hazard, but always
with great deliberation and forethought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Have a distinct end in view and
watch for the best opportunity to attain
it.</p>

<p>Such definite aims may be: to interfere
with a relief, a fatigue, a trench
construction or repair, to destroy accessory
defences, etc.</p>


<div class='sub'>77.&mdash;Keep it ready.</div>

<p>Let the mortars, etc., be kept loaded
and trained on the target selected,
ready to be fired instantly. The crews
should be near at hand and a sentinel
posted to watch for a favorable opportunity.</p>


<div class='sub'>78.&mdash;Save ammunition.</div>

<p>Until this opportunity occurs, do not
fire.</p>


<div class='sub'>79.&mdash;Have several emplacements.</div>

<p>Several emplacements should be provided
so that mortars, etc., may be removed
as soon as they have obtained
desired results or been located by the
enemy.</p>

<p>The trench mortar commander
should make it his business to study
carefully all possibilities for effective
emplacements and should inspire his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
men to be alert and quick to improve
opportunities.</p>


<div class='sub'>80.&mdash;Use of machine guns.</div>

<p>The machine guns should likewise
be handled as a mobile weapon and not
be used merely from elaborate carefully
concealed emplacements commanding
otherwise uncovered ground or enfilading
communication trenches, etc.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>


<div class='sub'>81.&mdash;Use of hand grenades.</div>

<p>Hand grenades may be listed as
trench artillery. The temptation is to
use them too freely. Like other ammunition
they should never be wasted
and always used with a definite aim.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTE:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3">[C]</a> Captain Hanguillart treats this important

<h2>FIELD ARTILLERY COOPERATION.</h2>


<div class='sub'>82.&mdash;Communications with the artillery.</div>

cooperate whether to repulse an enemy's
attack, to silence his artillery, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
damage his defences or to prepare and
protect an attack or a counter attack.</p>


<div class='sub'>83.&mdash;Observations posts.</div>

<p>To avoid a waste of ammunition, and
attain the desired result as well as to
prevent the artillery fire from falling
short upon one's own trenches, artillery
observation posts should be provided
in the fire trench or at one of
the outposts.</p>


<div class='sub'>84.&mdash;Artillery fire falling short.</div>

<p>In case artillery fire does fall short
upon one's own trenches, communicate
at once with artillery commander and
proceed as when bombarded by enemy.
(Cf. <a href="#par_69">69</a> ff.)</p>


<div class='sub'>85.&mdash;Artillery preparation of infantry
attack.</div>

<p>Special caution should be exercised
in the case of a raid against the enemy's
trench. Make sure that the artillery
preparation has secured the desired
result. Synchronize carefully the
infantry advance and the lengthening
of the artillery fire.</p>

<h2>DAILY SCHEDULE.</h2>


<div class='sub'>86.&mdash;Rosters and schedules.</div>

<p>Throughout the stay in the trenches,
the various fatigues should be assigned

French Infantry Combat<br />
Principles.<br />
</h2>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2>FRENCH INFANTRY COMBAT
PRINCIPLES.</h2>




<h2>OPEN WARFARE.</h2>


<div class='sub'>106.&mdash;Is open warfare probable?</div>

<p>It is improbable that in this war
trench warfare will definitely give place
on all sectors of the front to open warfare.</p>

<p>But the tactics that have forced several
retirements will force others.</p>

<p>If sufficient troops are available,
tried and fit and resolute, with the necessary
quantities of ammunition and
improved artillery, we shall see German
arrogance and brutality in victory
become again cringing fear and demoralization
in defeat; the experience of
the Marne will be repeated and the
invaders will be driven out of the territory
they swarmed over through
treacherous breaking of treaties.</p>


<div class='sub'>107.&mdash;The need of training in Infantry
Combat Principles.</div>

<p>That day the infantry will come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
again unto its own and its dash and
resolution will insure victory.</p>

<p>To achieve it, it must be a well trained
infantry, in the old sense of the
word. Officers, non-commissioned officers
and men must have a thorough
and practical knowledge of Infantry
Combat Principles.</p>

<p>These should be practiced in the intervals
of trench service when the battalion
is in rest billets.</p>

<p>Their theory should be thoroughly
mastered by all on whom may devolve
responsibility.</p>


<div class='sub'>108.&mdash;The two phases of the Combat.</div>

<p>We shall study here the two principal
phases of the combat: the approach
and the attack, from the point of view
of the company commander.</p>


<div class='sub'>109.&mdash;The Defense.</div>

<p>We shall also consider the Combat
from the standpoint of the Defense.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE APPROACH.</h2>


<div class='sub'>110.&mdash;All maneuvering at close range
impossible.</div>

<p>In the attack, the infantry can proceed
only straight ahead. Under infantry
fire all maneuvering is impossible.
Therefore by "approach" is
meant all maneuvering preparatory
to the attack: It brings the troops
directly in front of and as near as possible
to the objective.</p>




<h3>PRELIMINARY DISPOSITIONS TO
START THE APPROACH.</h3>


<div class='sub'>111.&mdash;The orders to attack.</div>

<p>The company commander will receive
his orders from the battalion
commander.</p>


<div class='sub'>112.&mdash;Equipment and Liaison.</div>

<p>In the meanwhile let the lieutenants:</p>



<div class='hang3'>a) make sure that the men are fully
equipped and provided with full
allotment of ammunition;</div>

<div class='hang3'>b) appoint and parade connecting
files (runners) to await orders.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>


<div class='sub'>113.&mdash;Distribution of Orders.</div>

<p>The company commander having
received his orders from the battalion
commander, will then call his subordinates
and issue his own orders accordingly,
including the formation to
be adopted.</p>


<div class='sub'>114.&mdash;Combat patrols.</div>

<p>He will make sure that there are
combat patrols on the exposed flank or
flanks and to the front and rear if
need be.</p>

<p>It is well to have combat patrols
detach automatically. It may be understood,
once for all, that, without
further orders, the first squad will
cover in front, the second to the right,
the third to the left, the fourth to the
rear, whenever needed. Still, the officer
in charge should make sure that this
arrangement is carried out.</p>

<p>A combat patrol, if not a full advance
guard, will thus always precede a unit
and be the first to take contact with
the enemy.</p>


<div class='sub'>115.&mdash;Officers as guides.</div>

<p>The officers serve as guides to their
units, until deployment, a mounted officer
in liaison with the advance guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
or advanced combat patrol checking up
the itinerary.</p>


<div class='sub'>116.&mdash;Keep Close Order as long as possible.</div>

<p>The advance of a company into an
engagement is conducted in close order,
preferably columns of squads, until
possible observation by the enemy
or encountering of hostile fire makes it
advisable to deploy.</p>

<p>Deployment should not be premature
and should always follow upon the
conditions arising during the progress
of the advance.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>




<h2>PRECAUTIONS AGAINST
HOSTILE ARTILLERY.</h2>




<h3>AGAINST SILENT ARTILLERY.</h3>


<div class='sub'><a id="par_117"></a>117.&mdash;Nearing artillery which may
open fire.</div>

<p>About two or three miles from the
positions liable to be occupied by the
enemy's field artillery, precautions
should be taken against the possibility
of its opening fire.</p>


<div class='sub'>118.&mdash;Deployment.</div>

<p>Deployments should be adopted best
suited to escape observation:</p>


<div class='sub'>119.&mdash;To escape direct observation:</div>

<p>March in single or double file, the
whole section<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> keeping closed up so as
to diminish the number of files seen
from the front.</p>


<div class='sub'><a id="par_120"></a>120.&mdash;Under aeroplane observation:</div>

<p>Avoid especially the center of roads
as they show white, utilize on the contrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the spaces between cultivated
fields of different colors, make use of
all possible cover, trees, shrubs, ditches,
embankments. Always walk in
the shade when possible. If hostile
aeroplanes are flying low, halt and lie
down on left side, hiding face in elbow.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTE:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_D_4" id="Footnote_D_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_4">[D]</a> The French "section" comprises 54 men.
It is thus equivalent to 7 squads, and may
be considered as 2 platoons.</p></div></div>

<hr class="chap" />


<h2>CROSSING A BOMBARDED ZONE.</h2>


<div class='sub'>121.&mdash;Case I. Artillery opening fire to
register.</div>

<p>A registering fire is easily recognized
as the German artillery registers either
with a single percussion shell at a time,
or with two time-shells at three seconds
interval.</p>

<p>In the German field gun, the setting
of the angle of sight<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> and of the elevation<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>
involves two operations.</p>


<div class='sub'>122.&mdash;Oblique to right then to left.</div>

<p>Therefore infantry under registering
fire should oblique forward rapidly.</p>


<div class='sub'>123.&mdash;Case II: Artillery opening fire for
effect.</div>

<p>The zone has necessarily been previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
registered. Such a zone is easily
recognized by the presence of shell
holes.</p>


<div class='sub'>124.&mdash;Avoid Zone if possible.</div>

<p>It should be avoided and the advance
made on its outskirts.</p>


<div class='sub'>125.&mdash;The five cases of fire for effect.</div>

<p>If this cannot be done and the fire
for effect materializes five cases are to
be distinguished as the shells may be:</p>



<div class='hang3'>1. Shrapnel shells bursting at right
height;</div>

<div class='hang3'>2. Shrapnel shells bursting high;</div>

<div class='hang3'>3. Time-Fuse high explosive shells
bursting at right height;</div>

<div class='hang3'>4. Time-Fuse high explosive shells
bursting high;</div>

<div class='hang3'>5. Percussion high explosive shells.</div>


<div class='sub'>126.&mdash;Case 1. Burst Area of Shrapnel
shells bursting at right height.</div>

<p>The area of burst is about 250 to
300 yards in length and 30 yards in
width, half the bullets falling on the
first 50 yards of the beaten zone.</p>


<div class='sub'>127.&mdash;Protective Formation against
Shrapnel.</div>

<p>Advance in line of section, in single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
or double file keeping as closed up as
possible with 30 yards intervals between
sections.</p>

<p>The second line should be 250 to 300
yards behind the first.</p>


<div class='sub'>128.&mdash;Case 2. Shrapnel shells bursting
high.</div>

<p>Much less dangerous than when
bursting at right height as initial speed
of bullets is spent. Same formation as
for Case 1.</p>


<div class='sub'>129.&mdash;Case 3. Burst area of Time-fuse
high explosive shells bursting at
right height.</div>

<p>The area of burst is opposite to that
of shrapnel: short depth, large width,
only 7 to 10 yards depths as opposed
to 60 to 100 yards in width.</p>


<div class='sub'>130.&mdash;Protective Formation against
Time-fuse high explosives.</div>

<p>Advance in line of section, single or
double file, keeping as closed up as
possible with 60 to 100 yards intervals
between sections.</p>

<p>The second line may be 15 yards
behind the first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>


<div class='sub'>131.&mdash;Case 4. High explosive shells
bursting high.</div>

<p>The depth of the area of burst is
longer than when shells burst at the
right height; therefore widen interval
between the lines.</p>


<div class='sub'>132.&mdash;Case 5. Burst area of percussion
high explosive shells.</div>

<p>The radius of the explosion is only
about 25 yards but the local effect is
intense and the displacement is effective
in more than double the radius.</p>


<div class='sub'>133.&mdash;Protective Formation against
percussion high explosive shells.</div>

<p>Advance in line of section in double
file, keeping as closed up as possible,
with about 100 yards intervals between
sections.</p>

<p>The second line may be about 50
yards behind the first.</p>


<h3>GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
AGAINST ALL TYPES OF
EFFECTIVE FIRE.</h3>


<div class='sub'>134.&mdash;Dangerous to stop, useless to run.</div>

<p>Do not stop in a zone under fire for
effect as lying down only provides a
larger target. If absolutely obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
stop, remain standing and packed together
like sardines, maintaining above
formations and intervals. It is useless
to run, but, as much as possible, advance
steadily.</p>


<div class='sub'>135.&mdash;Protective Formation against
all types of shells.</div>

<p>As may appear from the study of the
above the following formation and intervals
will afford the best protection
against all types and combinations of
types of shells, as a shell will never
affect more than one section.</p>

<p>Advance in lines of sections in double
file, keeping as closed up as possible,
with 85 to 110 yards intervals<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> between
sections.</p>

<p>The second line should be 250 to 300
yards behind the first.</p>

<h2>USE OF WOODS AS SHELTER ON
THE ADVANCE.</h2>


<div class='sub'>136.&mdash;Avoid if small.</div>

<p>They should be used to advance or
halt only if they are of considerable
size. Then, they hide movements and
provide some shelter from fire. On the
contrary, when they are small, they
are to be avoided as they draw artillery
fire and do not offer sufficient
protection.</p>


<div class='sub'>137.&mdash;Liaison difficult.</div>

<p>When advancing in woods, special
care should be taken to keep all fractions
connected.</p>


<div class='sub'>138.&mdash;Exit quickly at one time.</div>

<p>To exit from wood, take all necessary
dispositions under cover so that,
on the signal of the commander, all
fractions may be ready to spring out
together. They should continue to advance
forward, as rapidly as possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to avoid the enemy's likely shelling of
the outskirts.</p>


<div class='sub'>138.&mdash;Otherwise exit in different
places.</div>

<p>If the exit cannot be made by all
fractions at one time, the elements of
the second line should avoid coming
out at the same point as those of the
first line.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>TO CROSS A CREST.</h2>


<div class='sub'>139.&mdash;Cross altogether and rapidly.</div>

<p>Let the line of sections assemble at
top of crest, crouching carefully below
the sky line. Then, upon concerted
signal, all should leap quickly across
and down the descending slope, making
as extended bounds as possible.</p>

<p>This makes crossing fairly safe as
even the infantry will have to modify
both its elevation and angle of sight
for every new position of this quickly
moving target.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>PRECAUTIONS AGAINST CAVALRY.</h2>


<div class='sub'>140.&mdash;Cavalry Patrols.</div>

<p>During the whole "approach" watch
should be kept for possible cavalry
patrols. The elements acting as advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
guard and flank guards or as
combat patrols have as part of their
special mission to keep the cavalry
away from the main body.</p>


<div class='sub'>141.&mdash;Face and Fire.</div>

<p>To repulse cavalry, the infantry must
be able to face quickly toward the
charging horsemen and furnish a heavy
fire.</p>


<div class='sub'>142.&mdash;Protective formations.</div>

<p>If cavalry patrols are expected ahead,
deployment as skirmishers will secure
this, if on the flanks, deploy in columns
of squads marching in double file. A
formation in echelon is effective at all
times.</p>


<div class='sub'>143.&mdash;Repulsing the charge.</div>

<p>If cavalry appears, stop, face the
charge quickly, fix bayonets and fire at
will, the section leaders controlling the
fire.</p>


<div class='sub'>144.&mdash;In case of surprise.</div>

<p>If surprised, deploy quickly and lie
down.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE ATTACK.</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE TERMINATION OF THE
APPROACH.</h2>


<div class='sub'>145.&mdash;The Objective.</div>

<p>The standard objective of a battalion
is a maximum front of 550 yards.</p>


<div class='sub'>146.&mdash;Determination of the Objective.</div>

<p>On nearing the objective the battalion
commander reconnoiters rapidly to
determine the number of companies to
put in the front line and the part of the
objective to be assigned to each.</p>


<div class='sub'>147.&mdash;Horses sent back.</div>

<p>Mounted officers now send back their
horses to reserve battalion.</p>


<div class='sub'>148.&mdash;Assignment of position to companies.</div>

<p>The battalion commander assigns to
each company its part of the objective
and the position from which it is to
start the attack.</p>


<div class='sub'>149.&mdash;Getting into position for the
attack.</div>

<p>The orders are given verbally by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the battalion commander to the captains
and by the captains to the company
usually through the platoon leaders
as the company is not in close order.</p>


<div class='sub'>150.&mdash;Deployment before infantry fire.</div>

<p>As soon as the zone swept by the infantry
fire of the enemy is reached
(about 1000 yards) deployment as skirmishers
becomes imperative.</p>


<div class='sub'>151.&mdash;Methods of advance.</div>

<p>Keep on advancing toward positions
for the attack by fractions, varying
method according to the terrain; short
rushes, crawling, making use of all
possible cover.</p>


<div class='sub'>152.&mdash;Position of officers.</div>

<p>The battalion commander and the
captains march with the supports, the
battalion commander controlling the
despatch of reinforcements. As soon
as the supports are all sent forward
they march with the fraction nearest
the enemy.</p>


<div class='sub'>153.&mdash;Liaison.</div>

<p>A connecting file (runner) accompanies
the battalion commander and
each of the captains.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE FIRE ATTACK.</h2>


<div class='sub'>154.&mdash;The time to fire.</div>

<p>It is determined by the casualties.</p>


<div class='sub'>155.&mdash;The order to fire.</div>

<p>It is given by the captains; (only in
case of extreme emergency by a subaltern.)</p>


<div class='sub'>156.&mdash;Fire Control.</div>

<p>The section leaders, under the direction
of the captain; control the fire:
classes of firing, volley firing, firing at
will; the target (the nearest hostile
troops within the sector of the objective
being the usual target); the range,
the opening and cessation of fire in volley
fire.</p>


<div class='sub'>157.&mdash;Fire observation.</div>

<p>The section leaders are helped in
their observation of the fire effect by
observers standing besides them. The
fire is usually directed independently
by section or half section.</p>


<div class='sub'>158.&mdash;Verification of range.</div>

<p>In principle, the corporals do not
take part in the fire but verify the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
range and direction of the fire of their
respective squads.</p>



<h3>ADVANCING THE FIRING LINE.</h3>


<div class='sub'>159.&mdash;Methods of advance.</div>

<p>To advance the firing line in attack,
all means are good: by section, half-section,
squad, the only condition being
that it be by commanded fractions.</p>


<div class='sub'>160.&mdash;Closing in to replace casualties.</div>

<p>As men fall, the rest close in toward
the section leader, the sections rectifying
intervals on the sections furthest
advanced (the captain is with this section,
all sections being now in line.)</p>


<div class='sub'>161.&mdash;Closing in on the battalion front.</div>

<p>The several companies rectify intervals
in the same way on the furthest
advanced company (the battalion commander
being with this company).</p>


<div class='sub'>162.&mdash;Seize every opportunity to advance.</div>

<p>Every propitious occasion to advance
should be seized at once by the
various elements of the line: greater
effectiveness of the neighboring section's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
fire, slackening fire of the enemy,
effects of artillery, etc.</p>


<div class='sub'>163.&mdash;Each fraction protects advance of
neighbor.</div>

<p>The movement forward of each
fraction of the line should be protected
by the fire of the neighboring fraction.</p>


<div class='sub'>164.&mdash;Keep fit to fire accurately.</div>

<p>The fraction leader, after each rush
forward, should give time to the men
to get back their breath so that they
may fire with careful aim.</p>


<div class='sub'>165.&mdash;Liaison with the Captain.</div>

<p>The captain should be kept informed
by a conventional signal as to the need
of ammunition, etc.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>USE OF MACHINE GUNS IN THE
ATTACK.</h2>


<div class='sub'>166.&mdash;During the Approach.</div>

<p>Use them judiciously but boldly.
They should advance as first units.</p>


<div class='sub'>167.&mdash;During the fire attack.</div>

<p>Strive to keep abreast or ahead of
the most advanced elements especially
on the flanks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>


<div class='sub'>168.&mdash;During the charge.</div>

<p>Try to have them reach the objective
with the firing line and contribute to
the pursuit.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE COMPANY SUPPORTS.</h2>


<div class='sub'>169.&mdash;In liaison with the captain.</div>

<p>The sections kept in support are at
the disposition of the captain.</p>


<div class='sub'>170.&mdash;Method of advance.</div>

<p>Under the command of the section
leader, they advance, in double file, at
proper intervals or deployed, according
to their proximity to the enemy and
according to the terrain (covered or
uncovered).</p>


<div class='sub'>171.&mdash;Distance from the firing line.</div>

<p>They should be about 250 yards behind
the firing line to whose movements
they conform.</p>


<div class='sub'>172.&mdash;Supplying the firing line.</div>

<p>The section leaders keep in sight of
the captain and upon his signaled
command advance into the firing line
either to fill up a gap or to reinforce
a section.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>


<div class='sub'>173.&mdash;When filling a gap.</div>

<p>They advance as far as possible
ahead of the line.</p>


<div class='sub'>174.&mdash;Reinforcing.</div>

<p>They come up with a rush and shout
to rehearten the line.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE COMPANIES IN SUPPORT.</h2>


<div class='sub'>175.&mdash;Position.</div>

<p>They are kept out of range of the
enemy's fire upon the firing line but
near enough to interfere as soon as
called upon.</p>


<div class='sub'>176.&mdash;Liaison with battalion commander.</div>

<p>The captains keep in touch with the
battalion commander.</p>


<div class='sub'>177.&mdash;Advance into action.</div>

<p>These companies advance into the
fire zone with the necessary precautions,
either by fractions or entire, taking
advantage of favorable conditions:
inefficiency of the enemy's fire, effectiveness
of the firing line, etc.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE CHARGE.</h2>


<div class='sub'>178.&mdash;The final aim.</div>

<p>The charge is the final aim of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
whole attack. Its success means the
defeat of the enemy.</p>


<div class='sub'>179.&mdash;Caution.</div>

<p>It should not be launched too soon.</p>


<div class='sub'>180.&mdash;By whom ordered.</div>

<p>The order may come directly from
the commander of the attacking line or
be solicited by any of his subordinates.</p>


<div class='sub'>181.&mdash;Method of advance.</div>

<p>Fix bayonets, advance, stop to fire,
advance again, but always so as to arrive
on the enemy's position without
being out of breath.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE PURSUIT.</h2>


<div class='sub'>182.&mdash;One essential rule.</div>

<p>It should be vigorously pressed.</p>


<div class='sub'>183.&mdash;Organize new position.</div>

<p>In the meanwhile the conquered position
should be organized.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>




<h2>SPECIAL FEATURES OF THE
ATTACK.</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>ATTACK OF A WOOD.</h2>


<div class='sub'>184.&mdash;First objective.</div>

<p>In the attack of a wood, the first
objective should be the outskirts. Concentrate
the first effort on the salients.</p>


<div class='sub'>185.&mdash;Method of Advance.</div>

<p>As soon as the wood is penetrated,
advance quickly forward, utilizing all
roads, paths and trails. The company
advances by sections or half sections,
in single or double file, preceded by
strong patrols.</p>

<p>Every effort should be made to close
in with the bayonet.</p>


<div class='sub'>186.&mdash;Outflanking.</div>

<p>The companies or fractions on the
flank strive to outflank the enemy so
as to attack him on the flank or from
behind.</p>


<div class='sub'>187.&mdash;Frontal Attack.</div>

<p>The companies or fractions in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
center try to get across the wood as
quickly as possible, or, at least, to
reach a clearing.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>ATTACK OF A VILLAGE.</h2>


<div class='sub'>188.&mdash;First Objective.</div>

<p>In the attack of a village, the first
objective should be the nearest outskirt.</p>


<div class='sub'>189.&mdash;Organize.</div>

<p>Consolidate this first position as soon
as conquered. Signal to the artillery
to lengthen the range.</p>


<div class='sub'>190.&mdash;Frontal attack.</div>

<p>Then try to gain as rapidly as possible
the opposite end.</p>


<div class='sub'>191.&mdash;Outflanking.</div>

<p>The flanking units endeavor to encircle
the objective.</p>


<div class='sub'>192.&mdash;Against interior defense.</div>

<p>If the defense has been strongly organized
inside the village, fight forward
step by step. Blow up the obstacles
with explosives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>


<div class='sub'>193.&mdash;Cooperation of Artillery.</div>

<p>Have artillery bring up a few guns
within close range.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>ATTACK OF A DEFILE.</h2>


<div class='sub'>194.&mdash;When defended in front.</div>

<p>If it is defended in front, try to advance
rapidly by one or both flanks,
small fractions only attacking on the
valley bottom, while the greater part
of the attacking force progresses on the
heights on either side, the flanks striving
to keep forward so as to reach the
other end before the defenders and encircle
them.</p>


<div class='sub'>195.&mdash;When defended in rear.</div>

<p>If the defile is defended at the farther
end, as in the case of a bridge,
echelon units (properly covered) for
heavy concentrated fire from the bank
held and cross the bridge on the run
and in small groups.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>NIGHT ATTACKS.</h2>


<div class='sub'>196.&mdash;Of limited scope.</div>

<p>They must be confined to simple
movements over easy ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>


<div class='sub'>197.&mdash;Orders to be given.</div>

<p>They must be carefully prepared
secretly beforehand in every detail. The
orders must include detailed particulars
on the role of each unit or fraction
of units, precise data on the rallying
points and on the signals to be used.</p>


<div class='sub'>198.&mdash;Small units used.</div>

<p>For many reasons, chief among
which is the difficulty of handling
large units at night and maintaining
contact, small units should be used.</p>


<div class='sub'>199.&mdash;A battalion the maximum.</div>

<p>The fire of the adversary being negligible
at night, there is seldom any advantage
in putting more than a battalion
in line against a given objective,
the quality, discipline and cohesion of
the troops making up for the number.</p>


<div class='sub'>200.&mdash;Special precaution.</div>

<p>Before beginning the approach, carefully
secure all arms and utensils so
as to prevent noise. Fix bayonets.</p>


<div class='sub'>201.&mdash;Method of advance.</div>

<p>Walk in double files on sides of
roads, never in the center. Otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
as long as practicable, in columns of
squads.</p>


<div class='sub'>202.&mdash;Liaison.</div>

<p>Commands are to be transmitted in
a low voice by connecting files.</p>


<div class='sub'>203.&mdash;To secure surprise.</div>

<p>Keep absolute silence. Forbid all
lights. No smoking allowed.</p>


<div class='sub'>204.&mdash;Reconnaissance.</div>

<p>The itinerary should be reconnoitered
beforehand, if possible, and index
stakes planted; otherwise an officer
should precede with a luminous compass
and men to plant the stakes.</p>


<div class='sub'>205.&mdash;No fire before charge.</div>

<p>Do not answer the enemy's fire until
the charge.</p>


<div class='sub'>206.&mdash;Quickness essential.</div>

<p>Success depends above all on the
rapidity and continuity of the advance.
Get there as quickly as possible.</p>

WOODS, VILLAGES, DEFILES.</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>DEFENSE OF WOODS.</h2>


<div class='sub'>207.&mdash;Distribution of Troops.</div>

<p>The commander should distribute his
command so as to provide a defense
of the outskirts, an interior defense and
reserves for a counter attack.</p>


<div class='sub'>208.&mdash;The outskirt defense.</div>

<p>The outskirts defense troops should
organize their positions and remain
hidden near the combat emplacements
until the attack is announced as impending
by their sentinels.</p>


<div class='sub'>209.&mdash;The interior defense.</div>

<p>The interior defense troops should
organize their positions (abatis, barb-wire)
on the edges of clearings and
other open spaces so as to secure convergent
fire.</p>


<div class='sub'>210.&mdash;The Reserves.</div>

<p>The counter-attack reserves should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
be placed in the rear and on the outside
of the flank best suited for launching
a counter attack. They should
proceed to organize the ground so as
to prevent the enemy from issuing
from the wood, and should strive to
keep on.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>DEFENSE OF A VILLAGE.</h2>


<div class='sub'>211.&mdash;Distribution of Troops.</div>

<p>The same as for the defense of a
wood.</p>


<div class='sub'>212.&mdash;The exits.</div>

<p>The outskirts defense organization
should include trenches and accessory
defences before all the exits. These
should be strongly barricaded.</p>


<div class='sub'>213.&mdash;Interior strong point.</div>

<p>The interior defense should be organized
about the houses most strongly
built and least visible to the enemy's
artillery. It should include hidden
communications between these strong
points, thus facilitating a prolonged
defense.</p>


<div class='sub'>214.&mdash;Special precautions.</div>

<p>The streets should be barricaded and
loopholes provided in the walls of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
houses. Precautions should be taken
against fire: pails of water, boxes of
sand provided in the houses.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>DEFENSE OF A DEFILE.</h2>


<div class='sub'>215.&mdash;To keep the exits open for an
advance.</div>

<p>If the aim is to keep the exits open
so as to permit the advance of troops,
the defense should be organized at
some distance in front of the defile: far
enough to permit the unimpeded progress
of the advance.</p>


<div class='sub'>216.&mdash;To keep exits open for a retreat.</div>

<p>If the aim is to keep the exits open
so as to cover the retreat of troops, the
roads at the bottom of the defile should
be left free and the defense troops so
placed as to draw the enemy's fire on
other points.</p>


<div class='sub'>217.&mdash;To block the defile.</div>

<p>If the aim is to block the defile, the
defense should be organized in the interior
of the defile on both sides of the
place of greatest width, so as to secure
convergence of fire. Echelon detachments
all along the defile to act as a
rear guard in case a retreat is necessary.
Keep the flanks well protected.</p>

<h2>NIGHT DEFENSE OF A POSITION</h2>


<div class='sub'>218.&mdash;Precautions against attack.</div>

<p>Attack should be guarded against by
accumulating obstacles and the defense
further prepared by previous reconnoitering
of the best ground for counter-attacks.</p>


<div class='sub'>219.&mdash;Receive with violent fire and immediate
counterattacks.</div>

<p>The enemy's charge should be met
with a violent fire at the shortest possible
range, followed immediately by
counter-attacks with the bayonet, especially
on the flanks.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE COUNTER ATTACK.</h2>


<div class='sub'>220.&mdash;Confine to definite Objective.</div>

<p>Indicate the objective very definitely
including the position to be reached
but not gone beyond.</p>

<p>Its direction should not interfere
with the fire of neighboring troops.</p>


<div class='sub'>221.&mdash;Necessary Reconnaissance.</div>

<p>The Counter Attack should be prepared
cautiously and the itinerary carefully,
even if rapidly, reconnoitered.
(This may have been done as part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the preparation of the defense. It
should be done with special care if the
counter-attack is to take place at
night.)</p>


<div class='sub'>222.&mdash;Watch for opportunity.</div>

<p>It may be decided upon independently
of the incidents of the defense or to
take advantage of the mistakes or
weakness of the adversary.</p>


<div class='sub'>223.&mdash;Counter from short distance.</div>

<p>The most favorable moment is when
the enemy is within a short distance
and its artillery consequently obliged
to stop or to lengthen its fire.</p>


<div class='sub'>224.&mdash;Sudden and intense fire.</div>

<p>It should be launched suddenly so as
to surprise the enemy and pushed vigorously,
the fire being increased to
great intensity along the whole front.</p>


<div class='sub'>225.&mdash;Rapid and continuous advance.</div>

<p>Rapidity and continuity of advance is

<p>The following questions cover the principles
of combat in open warfare. These
principles have been supplemented rather
than changed in the light of experience
since 1914. In their original form, as given
in this book, they still may be considered
as fundamental. Compare them carefully
with the treatment of the same topics in
the larger works recommended. The questions
are shaped to cover the topics supplemented.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.&mdash;What is the difference between
"trench warfare" and "open warfare"?</p>

<p>2.&mdash;What is meant by the "combat"?</p>

<h3><a id="EXPLANATION_OF_PLATE_I"></a>EXPLANATION OF PLATE I.</h3>


<p>The following may be considered a
standard scheme of distribution of
troops, for trench warfare, in a fully
developed trench system.</p>

<p>An infantry division is composed of
two brigades, each brigade of two
regiments, each regiment of three battalions.
Each brigade thus has six
battalions, each battalion numbering
1026 officers and men, normally divided
into four companies.</p>

<p>One battalion occupies about 1000
yards in ordinary trench warfare. As
reliefs must be frequent, three battalions
of each brigade will be on duty,
while the other three are in rest-billets,
at least two miles back of the trenches.</p>

<p>Two of the battalions on duty occupy
the trenches, the third is stationed
about a mile back, in reserve.</p>

<p>A brigade can therefore hold about
2000 yards of trenches: two battalions
in front line trenches, one battalion in
reserve, and three battalions in rest
billets.</p>

<p>Hence a division (two brigades) will
hold a front of about 4000 yards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Within each 1000 yards front, the
distribution may be as follows:</p>

<p>Three platoons of Companies A, B,
and C occupy the dugouts of the cover
trench and of the support trench and
post sentinels by roster in the fire
trench.</p>

<p>Platoon No. 4 of each company occupy
the dugouts of the reserve trench,
together with the entire Company D.</p>

<p>Platoons and companies then relieve
one another according to roster, a
platoon of each company and an entire
company, in turn, enjoying comparative
rest in the reserve trench even
during the stay of the battalion in the
trenches.</p>

<h3><a id="EXPLANATION_OF_PLATE_II"></a>EXPLANATION OF PLATE II.</h3>


<p>The following is a description of the
back areas of a divisional sector in
which there has been no great changes
since 1915. There are still several
hundred miles of such sectors.</p>

<p>The line at the top marks the beginning
of the trench-system described
in Plate I. being the entrance to the
communication trenches.</p>

<p>Road a, b, with the river c, d, run
at the bottom of a small valley surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
by hills of about 80 ft. elevation.
A branch of the river runs from
c. to e. and a railroad beside it, along
road h, i, and crossing road j, k. A
good size village is at D, a smaller one
at C, hamlets at A and B. The latter
are about one mile back of the trenches,
village C. about two miles and
village D. between three and four.</p>

<p>Hamlets A and B have probably
been heavily bombarded at the time
line was established and have been
evacuated by the civilians. Village C.
has received shells, but, if there has
been no big attack in the sector, is in
fair shape and some of the inhabitants
remain. Village D. may also have
suffered from shells but probably most
of the inhabitants remain. Such villages
may be clusters of farms or of
cottages, depending upon the region.
If village is made up of cottages, farm
houses will be found along the roads
at frequent intervals. The fields are
likely to be under cultivation almost
as far as road k, l.</p>

<p>Villages A, B, C are used to billet
the battalion in reserve of each brigade.
Village D. and the nearest villages
further back are used as rest-billets
by the battalions of the brigades
who will relieve those in the trenches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Near or in villages A, B and C or
near hill E and G are located the transports
of the infantry battalions in the
trenches. Supplies are sent daily to
the trenches from this headquarters of
the quartermaster and transport officer.</p>

<p>Somewhere along road k, l, or about
hills E and G are hidden in gun pits
the batteries of field artillery attached
to the division. The men live in dugouts
alongside. The camps for the
horses, wagons and supply headquarters
of these batteries are hidden in the
woods or on the further slopes of hills
E, F, G.</p>

<p>In village D are very likely located
the Brigades' headquarters and such
services as the Field Ambulance and
the Divisional Supply Departments.
The Y. M. C. A. recreation centers,
divisional theatre, football fields, army
canteens etc., are also located in village
D or just back of it. If the
houses in the villages do not provide
enough billets, huts and tents are
erected. Otherwise the officers are
billeted in the houses of the inhabitants
and the men in the barns.</p>

<p>The Divisional Headquarters, the
Ammunition Column, the Artillery
Brigade Headquarters, the Engineers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the Ammunition Dumps, etc., are
strung out in the villages and along
the roads just back of village D. The
heavier artillery is also posted back of
this line.</p>

<p>In sectors that have been the scenes
of offensives the several elements remain
in the same relation, but as the
villages have been obliterated, shelters
must be provided. [The Editor.]</p>
